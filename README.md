# Spring Data JDBC and MyBatis Integration Example

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Spring Data JDBC** and **MyBatis** for a Spring Boot application, showcasing the use of Spring Data's repository abstractions alongside MyBatis's XML-based mappers for complex queries.

## Overview

This sample achieves the goal to do Spring data JDBC query along with Mybatis query in one repository:
- **Spring Data JDBC** for simple CRUD operations with repository management.
- **MyBatis** for handling complex SQL queries that exceed Spring Data JDBCâ€™s capabilities.
- Combining annotations and XML-based queries in the same project for flexibility.

## Features

- CRUD operations using Spring Data JDBC repositories.
- Advanced SQL queries using MyBatis with XML mappers.
- Support for H2 in-memory database for easy setup and testing.
  
## Technologies

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JDBC**
- **MyBatis**
- **H2 Database** (for testing)
